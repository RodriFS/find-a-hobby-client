# Find a Hobby 2.0

An open source contribution to find a hobby [Github](https://github.com/jportella93/find-a-hobby-client), made in collaboration with Alvaro Hernandez [Github](https://github.com/alvaroha1/find-a-hobby-client)

# The idea
To improve user experience, design and functionality by implementing Sass and Redux.

# Motivation
The main objective of this project was to take an already existing project and continue working on it. The original Find-A-Hobby was a great fit for us as a team because we both like the original idea but at the same time we thought we could take it to a whole new level.
